introduction:
starting any business now is very hard because of the highly competitive markets and this applies to every kind of business
and ofcourse it is a big problem especially for startups.
I am trying to solve this problem for a specific scenario which is:
someone want to open a resturant in crowded city like tokyo, cairo, newyork, ...etc
ofcourse it would be hard to find the spot that people will go to him in it as there are many restaurants in the area
and areas without resturants doesn't have restaurants for a reason (like: people don't afford restaurants, not safe, ..etc)
i will use forsquare data to solve this problem by searching for an area that will make a new restaurant POPULAR.

data:
i will only use the forsquare data, i will search for resturants and i will get their ratings and delivery id and location 
so i would be able to analyze their data and apply ML models to find the best place.
